# School-Projects
This repository is a collection of projects that I have worked on in my Master's Program. The Programming HW folder contains a project from undergrad.

DBsystems1: 
Created a Web Interface with a backend database. The user has the option to choose a query and view the results on the page. The URL is given in the directory.

Machine_Learning: 
Contains a few implementations of Machine Learning Algorithms from scratch. Methods include Linear_SVM, Kernel_Perceptron (error...), KNN, Perceptron, PCA.

PeanutPodsDL:
Used Google Collab notebook to apply segemented peanut pod data to a Convolutional Deep Neural Network for peanut pod classification.

ProgrammingHW_ClaytonHaley:
Impemented three algorithms, comparing the time complexities of both. The actual time and the theoritcal time complexities were compared.

EEG:
Transformed EEG signals using Hilbert-Huang Transform and Continuous Wavelet Transform. Converted Transformed signals to RGB images to be used in a TensorFlow Neural Network.
